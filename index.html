                    Decreasing the amount of energy spent on lighting your residence goes beyond remembering to turn the lights off.
                    Many homes still use archaic incandescent bulbs that <strong>waste 90% of its energy</strong> to heat, and a simple switch to smart 
                    bulbs could lead to a <strong>smaller carbon footprint</strong> and <strong>lower electric bills</strong>.

                    Among these alternatives, <strong>LED smart bulbs</strong> stand out. They are far more durable without the easily-broken mercury filaments of CFL bulbs, and have a <strong>lifetime of more than 22 years</strong> when used for 3 hours a day on average.

                    Besides their efficient use of energy, smart bulbs allow homeowners to dim or match the ambiance of a room by changing the color of the bulb <strong>from anywhere</strong>.

                    Despite the ease of being able to turn your appliances off from the comfort of your bed, smart plugs offer an <strong>energy-saving</strong> solution to vampire power and appliances that draw power for 24 hours a day.

                    Research has shown that American homes pay up to <strong>$150 a year</strong> on energy from electronic devices that are plugged in even when they aren&rsquo;t used.
